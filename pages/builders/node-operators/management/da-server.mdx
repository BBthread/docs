# Run a DA Server in Plasma Mode Alongside Your Node

<Callout type="error">
  **This is beta software.** For now, we only recommend spinning up testnets and staying in touch with [developer support](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions) for deploying these chains to mainnet.
</Callout>

This guide walks you through how to run a DA server in plasma-mode alongside your node. This process is for both full and archive nodes.
Plasma Mode is available in the latest [`op-node` v1.7.3](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/v1.7.3).

<Steps>
  ### Connecting to the S3 Bucket

  For centralized DA, node operators must run a DA server alongside your node to properly read from. You have two options:

  *   Option 1: Connect to the S3 bucket
  *   Option 2: Connect to the public get URL (provided by the chain operator)

  ### Configuring `op-node`

  You can now spin up your node and set a few flags to enable plasma mode. No configuration changes are required for `op-geth`.

  *   Set the `--plasma.enabled=true` flag for `op-node`.
  *   Point `op-node` to the DA server by setting  `--plasma.da-server=$DA\_SERVER\_HTTP\_URL`.

  ```go
      --plasma.da-server value                                               ($OP_NODE_PLASMA_DA_SERVER)
            HTTP address of a DA Server
     
      --plasma.enabled                    (default: false)                   ($OP_NODE_PLASMA_ENABLED)
            Enable plasma mode
     
      --plasma.verify-on-read             (default: true)                    ($OP_NODE_PLASMA_VERIFY_ON_READ)
            Verify input data matches the commitments from the DA storage service
  ```
</Steps>

## Next Steps

*   To run an OP Chain in plasma-mode with centralized DA, see the [DA Server guide](/builders/chain-operators/management/plasma-cda) for chain operators.
*   For detailed information on Plasma Mode, see the [specs](https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/plasma.html).
